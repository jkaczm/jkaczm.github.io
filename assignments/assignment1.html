            <li>Write a program that asks for your first name, email, and your major (entered as one word), and then prints everything back to the terminal at once in the end.
                <p>For example, your program should look like this: </p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">
                    $ What is your name? James
                    $ What is your email? jameskaczmarczyk00@qc.cuny.edu
                    $ What is your major? ComputerScience
                    Hello, James
                    Your email is jameskaczmarczyk00@qc.cuny.edu
                    Your major is ComputerScience
                </code></pre>
                <p>Note: When you enter your major, it should be entered as only one word, or else only the first word will be stored in the variable</p>
            </li>
            <li>Write a program that calculates the area and circumference of of a circle.  The user will enter the radius.  Assume the value of pi is 3.14
                <p>For example, your program should look like this: </p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">
                    $ What is the radius of the circle? 5
                    The circumference is 31.4
                    The area is 78.5
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>Write a program that calculates the sum of all of the change in your pocket.  The sum should be in dollars.  The program asks the user to enter 
                how many of each type of coin he or she has.
                <p>For example, your program should look like this: </p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">
                    $ How many quarters do you have? 7
                    $ How many dimes do you have? 2
                    $ How many nickels do you have? 3
                    $ How many pennies do you have? 6
                    You have 2.16 in change
                </code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Email me if you have any questions</p>
