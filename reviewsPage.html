            <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10%;">Here I write recommendations for books and authors that are relatively unknown.  By relatively unknown, I mean unknown in regard to the general public; they may be quite popular for fans of the specific genre.  I also include books that may be quite well known, but books that most people certainly have never read.  </h3>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 10%">Author Algernon Blackwood</h4>
            <p><blockquote>"I think the most frightening quality in a monster – real or fictional, human or otherwise – is its distance from our world of common human understanding; the sense that we are confronted by some sort of awareness that is absolutely nothing like our own, with interior processes and perceptions and agendas that are utterly foreign to our own and which are therefore unreadable to us. In this sense, things like werewolves, vampires or H.R. Giger’s franchised aliens aren’t really any more disturbing than a runaway car that’s heading in your direction. If there’s something with fangs or teeth like a typewriter carriage that’s making its way towards you, then you probably don’t have that many questions about its motivations, or your own: it’s evidently trying to kill you, and you , just as evidently, would rather not be killed. Being killed, whether it be by a tumour, a drunk and masturbating truck driver or a reanimated mummy enacting a vengeful curse, is something that, as humans, we should probably be used to by now. Something wanting to kill us...often a really ugly and monstrous something...has been our constant companion since the Palaeolithic. Much more alarming, in my estimation, is the entity of which we haven’t the faintest idea what it wants; the dancing dwarf in Twin Peaks as opposed to the shuffling and brain-seeking cadavers of our zombie movies. This posited unknowable entity doesn’t even have to mean you any harm or be aware of your existence in order to terrify. The very fact of its irresolvable and unfathomable nature is enough to haunt and obsess us forever after, to the point where we might end up wishing that we’d encountered a nice, down-to-earth, uncomplicated rampaging sasquatch instead." - Alan Moore</blockquote></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px">I think this idea of what constitutes true horror is especially evoked in books, as opposed to movies or tv, because the author has more tools at his disposal to give voice to the characters’ inner processes and give detailed phenomenological descriptions.  It is with this quote in mind that I extend my admiration to one of my top five favorite authors: Algernon Blackwood.  Nothing else has given me such a peculiar feeling of eerie dread than one of Algernon Blackwood’s short stories.  They have a tendency to make the familiar seem unfamiliar and cause you to wonder about what the idea of something being real really means.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px">I recommend the collection Four Weird Tales, which contains the four short stories, “The Insanity of Mr. Jones”, “The Man Who Found Out”, “The Glamour of the Snow”, and “Sand”.   I also enjoyed “The Empty House”, “The Wendigo”, and “The Willows”.  “The Willows” especially evokes that feeling of unease that is characteristic of the type of horror Alan Moore describes.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 10%">From Hell by Alan Moore</h4>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px">I regard Alan Moore as the greatest comic book writer of all time.  Everyone is familiar with his most famous graphic novels such as Watchmen (which I regard as the greatest graphic novel of all time), V for Vendetta, and even League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, mostly because they have been made into popular movies.  Fewer are familiar with his epic graphic novel From Hell (which has also been made into a movie, but I’ve never seen it).  </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 50px">This unsettling piece of historical fiction tells the story of the serial killer known as Jack The Ripper.  It also serves as a tour guide through London.  The author goes into detail about the histories of notable landmarks, as well as the symbolism behind the architectural design.  At several points you forget you are reading a graphic novel and think you are reading a textbook on Victorian England.    The author crafts his story with historical accuracy, while taking full advantage of artistic freedom to speculate on Jack The Ripper’s true identity.  </p>
